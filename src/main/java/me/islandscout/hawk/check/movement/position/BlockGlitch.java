    //Just rubberband to the previous location if they were/are on the block

    //Look, if you're going to rubberband to a location like that, you should make a priority system. For example, if
    //you jump on a phantomblock that gets cancelled, and then X moves ahead if you get flagged for speed AND fly (for failing phantomblock)
    //on the same move, and speed is before fly in the process list, you'll get rubberbanded to the speed legit location and not the fly legit
    //location; a fly bypass. The priority system should give priority to older setback locations if a conflict like this
    //should occur.
